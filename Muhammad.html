            <h1>
                Mohammed
            </h1>
            <p>
                Mohammed, also known as Muhammad, was the prophet who received a message from Allah, beginning the prayers of Islam in the seventh century. Muhammad received his first revelation in 610, when the angel Gabriel brought him a message from God.
            </p>
            <p>
                Muhammad was born in Mecca in 570, where Saudi Arabia is today. Muslims say that he was born in the month of Rabi al-Awwal, the third month of the Islamic calendar, and it is believed that this was in the month of April in the year 570. Muhammad was from the clan of the Hashemites, who were part of the tribe of the Quraysh.
            </p>
 
            <p>
                His father, Abd-Allah ibn Abd al-Muttalib, died before he was born. His mother's name was Amina bint Wahab, and she died around 576, when Muhammad was only six years old, so he was brought up by his grandfather, Abdul Mutalib, but he died when Muhammad was eight years old.
            </p>
            <p>
                Muhammad then passed into the care of his uncle Abu Talib. His uncle taught him the trade by which the Prophet of Islam survived for a long time, influencing Muhammad. Muhammad was a merchant and had a reputation as one of the most honest in Mecca, participating in caravans that went as far as Syria.
            </p>
            <p>
                Muhammad's reputation for loyalty was such that his services attracted the interest of Khadija, a widow who had a prosperous business. After working for her and showing that he could be trusted, Muhammad received a marriage proposal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Muhammad accepted and married her. Six children were born of the marriage, two men and four women, but none of them lived long.
            </p>
            <h1>His achievements and trajectory</h1>
            <p>
                His journey as a prophet began in 610, when he was away from Mecca. At the time, Muhammad was in a cave on Mount Jabl al-Mour when he had a supernatural vision. At that moment, he was asked to recite a sacred text, which he did:
            </p>
            <p>
                In the name of God, Most Good and Merciful:          
            </p>
             <p>
                Recite in the name of your Lord who created:
             </p>
             <p>
                Who created man from a lump of coagulated blood.
             </p>
             <p>
                Recite: Your Lord is Very Generous
             </p>
             <p>
                who taught thanks to the reed to write,
             </p>
             <p>
                who taught man what he did not know.
             </p>

             <p>
             Islamic tradition states that the event left Muhammad stunned and fearful. He told his wife, who took him to see Waraqah ibn Nawfal, a Christian priest. Nawfal allegedly told Muhammad that he had seen a vision of an angel sent by God. The angel who appeared to Muhammad was Gabriel and, in this revelation, what was being revealed was the Koran.
             </p>

             <p>
                Muhammad went on for a period without anything different happening, but eventually the visions returned. This happened in 613, and from then on Muhammad began preaching Allah's message. The people closest to him converted.
             </p>

             <p>
                After all this, life didn't get any easier for Muhammad. His influence in Mecca angered the local population, who were polytheists, so they expelled Muhammad from the city. In addition, the leader of his clan died, and the person who took over the leadership was a strong opponent of the religion, driving him out of his own clan. All this, together with the death of his wife, forced him to seek protection in other cities, and so Yathrib, later known as Medina, became his new home.
            </p>  
             <p>
                In Medina, Muhammad became a strong influence on the population, so he gathered people to fight against Mecca and conquer the city. There were several battles and many deaths, but in the end Muhammad managed to conquer Mecca and make it the holiest city in Islam.
             </p>


            <h1>His mark on humanity</h1>
            <p>
                Islam spread so quickly at the time that it dominated various regions, such as North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula and South-West Asia for centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, of all the areas they influenced, the most powerful was in the region where Spain is today.
                They contributed to the development of cartography and astronomy, chemistry and medicine, industry and commerce, architecture and mathematics, philosophy and literature. They introduced Hindu (today called Arabic) numerals to the West. They developed algebra and astronomy.

            </p>
            <p>
                More than simply a religion, Islam can be defined as a civilization, a movement that is at once political, religious, economic and social, which, at an extraordinary speed - both in terms of time and space - has expanded throughout the world, Islam began with the Arabs, but would not be limited to them. Before long, the Arabs would be one of the many peoples who formed Islamic civilization, alongside the Andalusians, Iraqis, Berbers, Iranians, Turks, Syrians and others.

            Albert Einstein
        </h1>
        <p>
            Einstein nasceu em uma humilde família judia. Durante a infância, os negócios familiares não iam bem, então seus pais decidiram mudar-se para Munique, onde ele obteve sua educação formal. Quando criança, não era o melhor aluno da classe, tampouco o pior, entretanto, apresentava uma clara predileção para as matérias exatas, como a Matemática.
            Em 1900, graduou-se em Matemática e Física. Após sua formatura, passou alguns anos desempregado e, apesar de almejar o cargo de professor-assistente, acabou sendo empregado pelo Departamento Oficial de Patentes de Berna, por meio da indicação de um amigo.
