            <h1>
                Albert Einstein
            </h1>
            <p>
                Einstein came into the world from a Jewish family of humble origins. During his childhood, the family
                struggled, leading them to move to Munich, where he received his formal education.
                 At a young age, he didn't stand out as the best or the worst student in his class, but his inclination for
                subjects, such as mathematics, was already evident.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1900, he completed his studies in mathematics and physics. After graduating, he faced a period of
                unemployment and, even though he aspired to a position as an assistant professor, he ended up getting a job at the
                Bern Patent Office, thanks to a referral from a friend.
            </p>

            <p>
                His modest salary, lack of time and marriage problems weren't enough to stop him from continuing his studies.
               In 1902, he began his doctorate at the University of Zurich and, in the final stages  of this phase, in 1905 (known as "the miracle year"), he published four revolutionary studies for 20th century physics. His work made him famous all over the world, earning him the position of
                professor at the University of Bern in 1908.

            </p>
            <p>
                Einstein died in 1955 at the age of 76, leaving behind three children - two from his first marriage and one from his second - many questions for various areas of physics, as well as an important scientific legacy.
            </p>
            <h1>His achievements</h1>
            <p>
              At the age of 25, in 1905, Albert Einstein published articles responsible for a major paradigm shift
                in current knowledge. They are:


            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "On a heuristic point of view concerning the production and transformation of light", which deals with the
                    absorption of light by the photoelectric effect.
    
                </li>
                <li>
                    "On the electrodynamics of moving bodies", a work that laid the foundations for an entirely new area of physics: restricted relativity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Does the inertia of a body depend on its energy content?", an article in which he presents the principle of
                    equivalence principle and the famous relationship between energy and rest mass: E = mc².
    
                </li>
            </ul>
           
            <p>
                In addition, various areas of knowledge, such as Quantum Optics, were
                driven by Albert Einstein's questions. Throughout his life, his dream was to
                formulate a theory capable of unifying all the fundamental forces in a single mathematical description.
            </p>
            <h1>His mark on humanity</h1>
            <p>
                Because of his scientific legacy, Einstein became one of the most famous and influential scientists of
                humanity. The theory of general relativity, for example, allowed us to create the GPS (Global Positioning System).
                How Earth's gravity influences the dispersion of electromagnetic waves,
                a
                series of corrections are made to the satellite signals, so that these satellites are able to locate us quickly and
                to locate us quickly and with great precision.

            </p>
            <p>
                Still in the field of the theory of relativity, Einstein foresaw the possibility of the existence of gravitational waves, which were detected in 2017 during the collision of two black holes.

            </p>
            <p>
                In the field of Quantum Mechanics, Einstein left a number of open questions, which in the future would lead to
                a new area of physics, Quantum Optics. Einstein's studies into the
              the behavior of light led him to explain the photoelectric effect, used in 
                photovoltaic cells, capable of producing solar energy, as well as laser light.

            </p>
            <p>
                Einstein was also able to establish a relationship of proportionality between mass and energy through
                his world-famous formula: E = mc². With this relationship, the physicist showed that the inertial mass
                (m) multiplied by the square of the speed of light (c²) is equivalent to an amount of energy .     And the   Einstein's conclusions about rest energy led to the creation of the atomic bomb and also to the
                nuclear power plants.

<!--  <h1>
            Albert Einstein
        </h1>
        <p>
            Einstein nasceu em uma humilde família judia. Durante a infância, os negócios familiares não iam bem, então seus pais decidiram mudar-se para Munique, onde ele obteve sua educação formal. Quando criança, não era o melhor aluno da classe, tampouco o pior, entretanto, apresentava uma clara predileção para as matérias exatas, como a Matemática.
            Em 1900, graduou-se em Matemática e Física. Após sua formatura, passou alguns anos desempregado e, apesar de almejar o cargo de professor-assistente, acabou sendo empregado pelo Departamento Oficial de Patentes de Berna, por meio da indicação de um amigo.
