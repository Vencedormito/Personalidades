            <h1>
                Isaac Newton
            </h1>
            <p>
                Isaac Newton was an English physicist, astronomer and mathematician. His work on the formulation of the three laws of motion led to the law of universal gravitation. The composition of white light led to modern optical physics. In mathematics, he discovered the foundations of infinitesimal calculus. His rigorous method of experimental investigation, as well as a precise mathematical description, became a model of research methodology for the sciences.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was born in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a small village in England, on January 4, 1643, and was baptized with the same name as his father, who died a few months before his birth.
                As his mother, Hannah Ayscough Newton, remarried and moved to another town, he was left in the care of his grandmother. When his stepfather died, he moved back in with his mother and was encouraged to look after the family land. However, he showed no aptitude for the task.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 1661 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. Although the curriculum at Cambridge was based on the philosophy of Aristotle, Newton dedicated himself to the study of various authors linked to the philosophy of mechanics. He read Galileo Galilei's Dialogue, René Descartes' works on philosophy, studied Kepler's laws on the planetary system and many other authors. In 1665, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in humanities, and in the same year, England was devastated by the plague and several establishments were closed, including Cambridge University.
            </p>
            <p>
                Newton died in London on March 31, 1727 due to kidney problems.
            </p>
            <h1>His achievements</h1>
            <p>
                At the time of the plague, Newton was forced to return to his farmhouse. During this time, he sought solutions to all the questions he had begun to ask as a result of his studies. At this time he developed the method of infinite series (Newton's binomial) and the foundations of differential and integral calculus. He also experimented with prisms, which led him to formulate color theory, and developed the reflecting telescope.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also studied circular motion and analyzed the forces related to this movement. He applied this observation to the movement of the moon and the planets in relation to the sun, which would become the basis for the Law of Universal Gravitation.
            
                In 1687 he published his most famous book: Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy).
            </p>
            <h1>His mark on humanity</h1>

            <h2> The mechanics of the cosmos </h2>

            <p>
              
                And it was through the work of Sir Isaac Newton that simplicity, elegance and scientific greatness showed themselves to the full. Ever since Aristotle, scientists have tried to explain the world through logical reasoning, observation and the methodical description of things.

            </p>
            <p>

                When researching the fall and movement of bodies, rather than describing observations and experiments, Newton organized them mathematically in a system of equations representing the phenomena in a precise and exact analytical framework.

            </p>

             <h2> Mathematical tools  </h2>

            <p>
        
                As the mathematics of his time was limited, Newton tried to improve it, becoming the inventor of integral differential calculus, a merit he shares with Leibniz.

            </p>
            <p>

                For all these reasons, the year 1687 would become decisive for the history of science: it was when Newton published his great work, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy".

            </p>
            <p>

                The Principia explained the laws of universal gravitation, demonstrating that material bodies attract each other in direct proportion to their masses and in inverse proportion to the square of their distances. This principle shows why the planets describe elliptical orbits around the Sun.


            </p>

                <h2>
                    The laws of the universe 
                </h2>

            <p>

                Also included in the great work were the laws of motion and inertia, the fundamental law of dynamics and the law of action and reaction, as well as the foundations of integral differential calculus and various other dissertations.

            </p>

            <p>

                The impact of the publication of the Principia was so great that the history of science can be divided into before and after it. If the complex cosmic movements of the stars could be described in a few simple equations and if these equations proved to be correct and confirmed every time they were compared with observations of the phenomena, then we existed in a universe governed by mathematical laws.
            </p>

            <p>
                Knowledge of these universally valid mathematical laws enabled us to make predictions about the final outcome of phenomena, just by knowing their causal variables.

            </p>

            <h2>
                Scientific determinism
            </h2>

            <p>

                Scientific determinism is the science that can determine with certainty the behavior of any physical phenomenon.


            </p>

            <p>     
                This deterministic view of science would only change in the 20th century, with the discovery of quantum phenomena that resulted in Heisenberg's development of the Uncertainty Principle.

            </p>

                <p>
                    Sir Isaac Newton was undoubtedly one of the greatest geniuses in history. In addition to his studies on gravitation and the movement of bodies, he made important discoveries about the composition of light and studies in chemistry, geometry, theology, alchemy and philosophy.
                   

                </p>
                <p>

                    Our technological world, built on mathematical engineering, would not be possible without his innovative statements on physical phenomena. Newton elevated science to a noble status and for this he earned the right to be called Sir, a well-deserved title for the noblest scientific mind of his time.

            Albert Einstein
        </h1>
        <p>
            Einstein nasceu em uma humilde família judia. Durante a infância, os negócios familiares não iam bem, então seus pais decidiram mudar-se para Munique, onde ele obteve sua educação formal. Quando criança, não era o melhor aluno da classe, tampouco o pior, entretanto, apresentava uma clara predileção para as matérias exatas, como a Matemática.
            Em 1900, graduou-se em Matemática e Física. Após sua formatura, passou alguns anos desempregado e, apesar de almejar o cargo de professor-assistente, acabou sendo empregado pelo Departamento Oficial de Patentes de Berna, por meio da indicação de um amigo.
