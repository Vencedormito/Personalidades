            <h1>
                Guglielmo Marconi
            </h1>
            <p>
                Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of the radio, was born in Bologna, Italy, in 1874. His family was well-off and he was educated by private tutors. In 1894, at the age of twenty, Marconi read about the experiments that Heinrich Hertz had carried out a few years earlier, which had shown the existence of invisible electromagnetic waves moving through the air at the speed of light.
             </p>
             <p>
                He was immediately excited by the idea that these waves could be used to send signals over great distances without the use of wires, which would open up many possibilities for communication that were impossible with the telegraph. For example, using this method, messages could be sent to ships on the high seas.
             </p>
            
             <p>
                In 1895, after a year's work, Marconi managed to invent a working device. In 1896, he gave a demonstration in England and received the first patent for his invention. Soon after, he formed a company and the first "marconigrams" were sent in 1898. The following year, he successfully sent wireless messages across the English Channel.
             </p>
             
             <p>
                Although his most important patent was granted in 1900, Marconi continued to improve his invention and patent many improvements. In 1901, he managed to send a radio message across the Atlantic Ocean from England to Newfoundland in Canada.
             </p>
             <p>
                The importance of the new invention was dramatically illustrated in 1909, when the ship S.S. Republic, damaged in a collision, sank at sea. Radio messages managed to get help and only six people could not be saved. That same year, Marconi won the Nobel Prize for his invention, and the following year, he managed to transmit radio messages from Ireland to Argentina, over a distance of more than six thousand miles.
             </p>
    
             <p>
                All these messages were sent using the Morse code system of dots and dashes. It was known, however, that voice could also be transmitted by radio, which was realized in 1906.
             </p>
    
             <p>
                Radio broadcasting on a commercial scale only began in the early 1920s, after which its popularity and importance grew very quickly.
             </p>
    
             <p>
                An invention like this, whose patent rights were extremely valuable, was bound to provoke legal disputes. The disputes, however, ended after 1914, when the courts recognized Marconi's clear primacy. Years later, he carried out important research into short-wave and microwave communications. Marconi died in Rome in 1937.
             </p>
    
             <p>
                As his importance is due to his work as an inventor, naturally his influence is proportional to the importance of radio and its direct derivatives. (Marconi did not create television, but the invention of radio was a precursor of the highest significance for television, and therefore it seems fair to give him some of the credit for the development of image transmission as well). Obviously, wireless communication is extremely relevant in the modern world, being used for news transmission, entertainment and other purposes. While the telegraph (invented more than a century earlier) serves some needs very well, radio is indispensable for many others. It can reach cars, ships at sea, airplanes in flight and even spacecraft.

            Albert Einstein
        </h1>
        <p>
            Einstein nasceu em uma humilde família judia. Durante a infância, os negócios familiares não iam bem, então seus pais decidiram mudar-se para Munique, onde ele obteve sua educação formal. Quando criança, não era o melhor aluno da classe, tampouco o pior, entretanto, apresentava uma clara predileção para as matérias exatas, como a Matemática.
            Em 1900, graduou-se em Matemática e Física. Após sua formatura, passou alguns anos desempregado e, apesar de almejar o cargo de professor-assistente, acabou sendo empregado pelo Departamento Oficial de Patentes de Berna, por meio da indicação de um amigo.
