            <h1>
                Christopher Columbus
            </h1>
            <p>
                Christopher Columbus was a Genoese navigator and explorer. He was the second European to reach the lands of the American continent, then known as the New World, in 1492.
            </p>
            <p>
                Christopher Columbus was born in mid-1451, probably in Italy, in Genoa, the city in which he became a navigator and explorer.
                He was a sailor from childhood and a brilliant cartographer as an adult, beginning to sail at the age of fourteen.
            </p>
 
            <p>
                Christopher probably lived in Portugal between 1476 and 1485. In 1482 he sailed with the Portuguese fleet, when he gained experience in navigation. He then began plans to travel to the West, given that Portugal had the best and most experienced sailors, but his request was denied by the Portuguese, so he went to Castile in 1485.
            </p>

            <p>
                He died in Valladolid on May 20th, 1506.
            </p>
      
            <h1>His achievements and trajectory</h1>
            <p>
                As India was in great demand at the time because it was a land with many precious metals, silks and spices, Columbus put together a plan for a trip route in 1484, and asked for the support of the king of Portugal, João II, but the Portuguese Council rejected it.
            </p>  

             <p>
                Columbus then moved to Spain and, still thinking about his project, went to see the kings Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile directly, but was rejected again. Still determined, he managed to get another audience with the kings in 1491, and was finally approved.
              </p>
             <p>
                On April 17, the Capitulations of Santa Fe were signed, documents that granted Columbus and his descendants possession of the lands discovered and 10% of the riches he conquered and that granted him and all his descendants the titles of Admiral of the Sea, Viceroy and Governor of the new territories.
            </p>
                <h2>
                    First trip
                </h2>
             <p>
                Columbus' plan was finally underway. The three ships were armed: Santa Maria, a larger ship, and two smaller caravels, Pinta and Nina.   The squadron set sail in search of the Indies on September 6, 1492, with a population of 88 men.
            </p>

             <p>
                On October 12, 1492, Columbus landed and took possession of the land in the name of Castile, in the place that was named San Salvador, which today is one of the islands of the Bahamas.    
            </p>
               
             <p>
                The navigator, who believed he had reached the Far East, continued his journey. He reached the Antilles, sailed along the north-east coast of Cuba and landed on the island he named Hispaniola (now occupied by the Dominican Republic and Haiti), and established the fort of La Natividad there.
            </p> 

             <p>
                Back in Spain, the navigator was greeted with festivities. He was summoned to court in Barcelona, where the sovereigns received them with great honors.  
            </p>
                  <h2>
                    Second Trip
                  </h2>
                <p>
                    On September 25, 1493, the second trip began, departing from Cádiz with 17 ships and provisions for six months. The ships carried religious, noblemen and servants of the royal house. They carried animals, plants, seeds and agricultural tools. 
                </p>
                   <p>
                    After 40 days they reached the small Antilles, including Puerto Rico. In Hispaniola, the fort had been destroyed by the natives. He explored the southern coast of present-day Cuba and discovered Jamaica. In Santo Domingo, in what is now the Dominican Republic, he founded Isabela, the first European settlement in the region.
                   </p>

                          <h2>
                            Third and fourth trips
                          </h2>

                        <p>
                            Christopher Columbus undertook two more trips, one in 1498 and the last in 1502, trying once again to reach the Indies. Traveling along the coast of present-day Central America, he spotted the area of what is now the Panama Canal.
                        </p>
                            <p>
                                The target of palace intrigues and colonizers who failed to make a fortune, Columbus was watched over by Juan de Aguado, an envoy of the sovereigns. Sick and exhausted, on September 12, 1504, Columbus returned to Spain in search of justice. Of the negotiations he had agreed with the sovereigns, he only received a plot of land and an adequate income, in exchange for renouncing the rights he was trying to recover. He only managed to get his son Diego appointed governor of the island of Hispaniola.    
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                Christopher Columbus died in Valladolid, Spain, on May 20, 1506, convinced that he had reached the Indies, without realizing the importance of the existence of a new continent between Europe and Asia.
                            </p>
            <h1>His mark on humanity</h1>
            <p>
                Trying to find a way from Europe to the East via the west, Columbus inadvertently discovered the Americas, and thus exerted a greater influence on world history than he could have imagined.  
            </p>
            <p>
                It opened up two new continents for the inhabitants of Europe, on which they established their expanding populations and provided them with sources from Europe. Its discovery led to the destruction of the civilizations of the American Indians. In the long term, it also led to the formation of a new group of nations in the western hemisphere, quite different from the indigenous nations that had inhabited the region, significantly affecting the nations of the old world.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Columbus' first trip had a revolutionary impact on the history of Europe and an even greater effect on the Americas. All students know the year 1492. However, Columbus is vulnerable to the argument that his feat would have occurred even if he had never existed. Europe in the 15th century was in turmoil: booming trade inevitably led to a tendency to explore. The Portuguese, in fact, had been actively seeking a new route to the Indies since considerably before Columbus. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, it seems likely that America would have been discovered by Europeans sooner or later, and quite possibly without much delay. The subsequent development, however, would have been different if America had been discovered, say, in 1510, by a French or English expedition, and not by Columbus in 1492. In any case, it was Columbus who actually discovered America, and this changes the whole story that followed.

        </h1>
        <p>
            Einstein nasceu em uma humilde família judia. Durante a infância, os negócios familiares não iam bem, então seus pais decidiram mudar-se para Munique, onde ele obteve sua educação formal. Quando criança, não era o melhor aluno da classe, tampouco o pior, entretanto, apresentava uma clara predileção para as matérias exatas, como a Matemática.
            Em 1900, graduou-se em Matemática e Física. Após sua formatura, passou alguns anos desempregado e, apesar de almejar o cargo de professor-assistente, acabou sendo empregado pelo Departamento Oficial de Patentes de Berna, por meio da indicação de um amigo.
